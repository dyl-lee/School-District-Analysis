# School-District-Analysis

## Overview
Evidence of academic dishonesty in standardized testing scores of ninth grade students in Thomas High School has prompted a reassessment of the school district's performance as a whole. In order to determine the extent of academic dishonesty, the analysis of the school district's performance was repeated after the math and reading scores of ninth grade Thomas High school students were removed from analysis.
